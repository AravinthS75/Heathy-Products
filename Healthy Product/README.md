node_modules folder is not added as it is a large size folder.
It will be added automatically when creating a react project.
To create a project ensure that you have installed 'Node.js' and open command prompt.
Now type 'node -v' to ensure node installation.
Now go to the project folder where you have to have the project and open command prompt in that location.
Now type in the command 'npx create-react-app app_name' and press enter. 
After the folder is created move inside the folder using 'cd app-name'.
Now type 'npm install' to install the react app.
Now all the required folders and the files will be installed inside the folder.
Now just download the given folders as a .zip folder and replace it inside the folder.
